# Capstone Projects Overview

Welcome to my Capstone Projects repository! This collection showcases three distinct software engineering projects that demonstrate a wide range of skills in data structures, algorithms, software development, and databases. Each project is the result of careful design, implementation, and enhancement to meet specific learning outcomes and demonstrate real-world technical expertise. Inside each project folder, you'll find a dedicated README file with detailed instructions on how to set up and test the project.

### 1. **Vampire Hunter Game**
This is a fully interactive, browser-based game where players take on the role of a vampire hunter. The game is built using Angular and Phaser, featuring custom game logic, animations, and user interactions. Key features include state management, inventory tracking, a dynamic map, and a storyline-driven experience. The project highlights front-end development, UI/UX design, and game logic implementation. Check the README inside the project folder for setup instructions.

### 2. **Algorithm Testing Application**
An educational tool that allows users to test and visualize the behavior of different sorting and searching algorithms. Built with Java and JavaFX, this application includes real-time visualizations of algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search. Users can compare performance metrics such as runtime and memory usage across different datasets. Detailed instructions for running the application are provided in the README inside the project folder.

### 3. **Grocery Tracker**
This project is a web-based application designed to track product sales, purchases, and store performance using a MySQL database and a Spring Boot backend. The application allows users to analyze sales data, view top-selling products, and track sales performance by region. Key features include advanced SQL queries, data visualizations, and secure user authentication. More information on the setup and usage of the app can be found in the README file inside the project folder.
