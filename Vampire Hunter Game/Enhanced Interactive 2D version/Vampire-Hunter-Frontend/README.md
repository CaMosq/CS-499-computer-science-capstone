**Version**: 1.0

**Developer**: Carmen Mosquera

**Description**: The **Vampire Hunter Game** is an immersive text-based adventure set in a small, eerie village plagued by the presence of a mysterious figure suspected to be a vampire. Players take on the role of a vampire hunter, tasked with navigating the village and its various locations to uncover and collect eight special items—Holy Water, Crucifix, Ancient Book, Garlic, Wooden Stake, Silver Sword, UV Light, and Health Potion—needed to defeat the vampire. Each location offers unique challenges, with hidden items that must be found and collected. Players must strategically explore the village, manage their inventory, and make critical decisions that impact the outcome of the game. With each move, they inch closer to confronting the vampire in a thrilling final showdown. The game combines elements of strategy, exploration, and item collection, creating an engaging narrative-driven experience.
